Product Bundling Requirement:

1. Database changes:
	a. New table: 

	ProductBundle
		(fk) ProductId
		(fk) AssociatedProductId
		QuantityToInclude
		SortOrder
		ModifiedDate
		ModifiedBy (userId of the currently logged on Admin user)
		
		
	b. Add Product.IsBundleFlag (nullable integer)


2. Admin.ProductDetail Screen changes
	a. Add a new 'section' to the Product Detail screen to include 'Is Product Bundle?' yes/no radiobutton
	b. When 'yes', display datagrid of currently associated Products (ProductName, Qty, SortOrder) in table above.
	c. Ability to Add/Delete an Associated Product (please ensure the modified date/by are inserted/updated as necessary)
	d. When 'no' selected, please ensure any ProductBundle rows are deleted
	
	
3. Exhibitor Checkout flow
	a. Within the 'Create Order' flow, need to interogate the Product.IsBundleFlag for 'yes'
	b. when 'yes', the Bundle itself will remain as-is (with calculated costs and fees),
	c. when 'yes', automatically create the OrderItems based on the ProductBundle above (Quantity comes from table, cost = $0.00) and please ensure the ItemIndex is maintained so that the 'Exploded' OrderItems under the Bundle are retained according to Sortorder of the bundle.
	
4. Stored procedure changes
	a. sp_CopyShow needs to account for the old/new ProductIds in the new table above when you copy the Show
	b. sp_CopyCategory needs to account for the old/new ProductIds in the new table above when you copy the category
	


The end-user flow is that:
1. Admin sets up a bundle ('Booth Package #1') that includes 1 table and 2 chairs.
2. Exhibitor purchases the 'Booth Package #1' from the site and is added to cart as usual
3. Exhibitor provides payment details and clicks the 'I accept' checkbox
4. When the Order is Created, the Order table will be the same, but the OrderItem table will include:
	- a line item for 'Booth Package #1' (quantity = 1); normal pricing/fees, etc.
	- a line item for 'Table' (quantity = 1); $0.00 cost and fees
	- a line item for 'Chair' (quantity = 2); $0.00 cost and fees
	
	
So, really the only thing we're doing is automatically exploding the ProductBundle into the Associated Line items.  And apart from that, there should theoretically be nothing else to do.
